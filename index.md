## About Me

I have experience in software, quality assurance, automation, manufacturing robots, construction, nuclear energy, and operations in critical facilities. Since 2017, I've been applying my experience to pioneer advancements in the fields of construction, and manufacturing, with an emphasis on sustainability and frugality.

My goal is to create an open-source platform to partially automate the design, construction, and maintenance of off-grid structures using sustainable materials, robotics, and machine-learning.

To kickstart this initiative, I'm developing an open-source, AI-cooperative, software platform to assist in operation of manufacturing robots such as 3D Printers.
