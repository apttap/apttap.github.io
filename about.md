## About Me

I'm a digital nomad embracing a primitive lifestyle as I travel the country on bike, with my dog, Dot.

I have extensive experience in software, automation, manufacturing robots, construction, and operations in critical facilities. Since 2017, I've been applying my experience to pioneer advancements in the fields of construction, manufacturing, with an emphasis on sustainability and frugality.

My goal is to create an open-source platform to partially automate the design, construction, and maintenance of off-grid structures using sustainable materials, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence. This will enable off-grid living and independence from financial obligations in order to live on planet earth.

To kickstart this initiative, I'm developing an open-source, AI-cooperative, software platform to assist in operation of manufacturing robots such as 3D Printers.
