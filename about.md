## About page

I'm a multi-hyphenate nomad currently traveling the country with my trusty canine companion Dot. With over 20 years of experience I create user interfaces that bring first-class accessibility to the world of instrumentation and controls software.

I have extensive experience in the world of automation and operations in critical facilities. For the past decade I have been working to apply my experience to break ground on the world of construction & manufacturing, to create open-source robotics and power generation to enable free, and off-grid housing solutions for those interested in sustainability and independence.

Whether it's open-source software, community art projects, or hardware hacks that improve lives, I'm excited to team up with others who share my passion for making a difference. I seek the challenge of creation, and the belief that technology can be a powerful tool for good.

If you're looking for a code-wielding explorer, a design-minded tinkerer, or a collaborator fueled by a desire to leave the world a little better than we found it, contact me.
